## Overview
SOFAJRaft is a production-level, high-performance Java implementation based on the [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/) consistency algorithm that supports MULTI-RAFT-GROUP for high-load, low-latency scenarios.
With SOFAJRaft you can focus on your business area. SOFAJRaft handles all RAFT-related technical challenges. SOFAJRaft is very user-friendly, which provides several examples, making it easy to understand and use.

## Features
- Leader election and priority-based semi-deterministic leader election
- Log replication and recovery
- Read-only member (learner)
- Snapshot and log compaction
- Cluster membership management, adding nodes, removing nodes, replacing nodes, etc.
- Mechanism of transfer leader for reboot, load balance scene, etc.
- Symmetric network partition tolerance
- Asymmetric network partition tolerance
- Fault tolerance, minority failure doesn't affect the overall availability of system
- Manual recovery cluster available for majority failure
- Linearizable read, ReadIndex/LeaseRead
- Replication pipeline
- Rich statistics to analyze the performance based on [Metrics](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.0.0/getting-started.html)
- Passed [Jepsen](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) consistency verification test
- SOFAJRaft includes an embedded distributed KV storage implementation

## Requirements
Compile requirement: JDK 8+ and Maven 3.2.5+ .
